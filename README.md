Examples of operations used in CNNs and NNs.  Human Learning Machine Learning. 

I found it hard to follow some neural network codes. I infact made my own 100% go 100% cpu based framework.  It was super ineffecient.  Here I am going to build working examples of the operations. Hopefully, we will get a significant boost in performance from what I originally wrote.
